## Version 0.9.2

Community version! Thanks to [NekohimeMusou](https://gitlab.com/NekohimeMusou).
- PC wound levels weren't being calculated correctly for display on the character sheet
- The option in the settings to use the Little Truths version of the 10 Dice Rule didn't do anything; now it does.
The full text of the rule from LT:

    Sometimes you will have an odd number of rolled dice above ten, which would normally mean a die is lost when you convert rolled dice to kept dice. Instead, such a “spare” rolled die becomes a +2 to the total of the roll. For example, 13k5 would convert to 10k6+2.

This is a global settings option and is off by default.

- The Ten Dice Rule is now correctly applied to damage rolls.
- The chat card for skill rolls now displays which trait is being used for the roll.
- Leaving the Armor TN Modifier field empty used to break the armor display and show an Armor TN of NaN; now it's treated as a 0.
- From [NekohimeMusou](https://gitlab.com/NekohimeMusou): Players in my group find it useful to be able to equip more than one "armor" piece, to represent added modifiers such as class techniques or buffs. This is now possible via a global config setting, which is off by default.
