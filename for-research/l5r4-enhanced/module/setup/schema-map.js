/**
 * @fileoverview L5R4 Schema Migration Map - Field Remapping Rules for Data Structure Updates
 * 
 * This module defines the comprehensive mapping rules used by the migration system to update
 * document data structures when field names or locations change between system versions.
 * Each rule specifies how to safely move data from old field paths to new field paths
 * while preserving data integrity and maintaining backward compatibility.
 *
 * **Core Responsibilities:**
 * - **Rule Definition**: Declarative field transformation specifications
 * - **Type Safety**: Document type and subtype-specific migration rules
 * - **Path Mapping**: Dot-notation field path transformations
 * - **Version Control**: Systematic tracking of schema changes across versions
 * - **Data Preservation**: Ensuring no data loss during migrations
 *
 * **Migration Rule Structure:**
 * Each rule is an object with the following properties:
 * - **docType**: Document type ("Actor" or "Item") - specifies which documents to migrate
 * - **type**: Document subtype ("pc", "npc", "skill", etc.) or "*" for all types
 * - **from**: Source field path using dot-notation (e.g., "system.old_field")
 * - **to**: Target field path using dot-notation (e.g., "system.newField")
 * - **version**: Optional version when this migration was introduced
 * - **condition**: Optional function to determine if migration should apply
 *
 * **Migration Categories:**
 * - **Naming Convention Updates**: snake_case â†’ camelCase conversions for consistency
 * - **Field Relocations**: Moving fields to new parent objects for better organization
 * - **Structure Reorganization**: Flattening or nesting data structures for efficiency
 * - **Legacy Cleanup**: Removing deprecated field names and obsolete properties
 * - **Type Conversions**: Converting data types while preserving semantic meaning
 * - **Validation Updates**: Adding validation constraints to existing fields
 *
 * **Safety Features:**
 * - **Idempotent Operations**: Safe to run multiple times without side effects
 * - **Type-Specific Rules**: Apply only to matching document types for precision
 * - **Universal Rules**: Use "*" type to apply to all subtypes when appropriate
 * - **Non-Destructive**: Only migrates when source exists and target doesn't exist
 * - **Rollback Support**: Maintains original field until migration is confirmed successful
 * - **Error Isolation**: Individual rule failures don't affect other migrations
 *
 * **Rule Processing Order:**
 * 1. **Type-Specific Rules**: Process exact type matches first
 * 2. **Universal Rules**: Process "*" type rules second
 * 3. **Dependency Resolution**: Handle field dependencies in correct order
 * 4. **Validation**: Verify migration success before cleanup
 * 5. **Cleanup**: Remove source fields only after successful migration
 *
 * **Usage Examples:**
 * ```javascript
 * // Rename a field for all Actor types
 * { docType: "Actor", type: "*", from: "system.old_name", to: "system.newName" }
 * 
 * // Rename a field for specific Item type
 * { docType: "Item", type: "weapon", from: "system.damage_roll", to: "system.damageRoll" }
 * 
 * // Conditional migration based on field existence
 * { 
 *   docType: "Actor", 
 *   type: "pc", 
 *   from: "system.legacy_field", 
 *   to: "system.modernField",
 *   condition: (doc) => doc.system.version < "2.0"
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * **Integration with Migration System:**
 * - **Rule Loading**: Migration system imports and processes these rules
 * - **Batch Processing**: Rules applied efficiently to document collections
 * - **Progress Tracking**: Migration progress reported using rule count
 * - **Error Handling**: Failed rules logged but don't stop migration process
 * - **Validation**: Rules validated before application to prevent errors
 *
 * **Performance Considerations:**
 * - **Rule Ordering**: Most common migrations placed first for efficiency
 * - **Type Specificity**: Specific type rules processed before universal rules
 * - **Batch Operations**: Multiple rules applied in single document update
 * - **Memory Management**: Large rule sets processed in chunks
